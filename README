This package has functions for inserting various LaTeX commands. Has ability to insert, delete, change enviroment. Has macros for operating on commands with two or more argument, etc.

Also there is functions for operating with citations and references. Mainly it's insertion into document, with quite user-friendly selection.

Now it has documentation, in style of VIM help files.

So if you have any wishes, ideas, etc. feel free to contact me.
