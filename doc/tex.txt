*basic_usage*	Basic Usage of TeX editing macros

This packages is in development, so if you can help to improve it, you are
welcome to post changes. Also good ideas are welcome.

The easiest way of using this packages is in GVIM, because of it's menu. In
this menu is enabled nearly all features of this macros. This is due to I want
give users ability to define their own key-mappings for written features.

So any questions, ideas, changes, etc. please post to my E-mail:
	xvaigl@fi.muni.cz

						Thank Karel VAIGL

*installation*	How to install TeX editing macros

Package now contain these four files:
	tex.vim			- Main macro file
	tex.file.vim		- This file I use for cooperation with my
				other macros packages
	tex.keybindings.vim	- Key-mappings definitions
	tex.menu.vim		- GUI menu definition

The easiest way for installing this is to create directory
"~/.vim/ftplugin/tex" and copy all of these files there. That every time you
start editing ".tex" file, vim load this macros for you. If you want
auto-initilization of TeX macros, you can do it by adding this line to your
personal settings.
	let g:TeX_do_init = 1
When you want do disable auto-initialization then write "0" on place of "1".
Or you can call function TeXInit() on that place you need to do it.

If have this, you also need to copy file "vi-bibtex.pl" to some place which is
in your current PATH. At all you need to do this only if you want to use
citation insert commands.

*bibtex*	How to use BibTeX databases with this package

This package has now support for only one bibliography database in document.
Function which performs searching throught citation has ability to find the
\bibliography{} command and it use this value.

Also you must have the script "vi-bibtex.pl" somewhere in your path. This
implies the need for installed perl interpreter.

If you add entry into this database you must call rescan of bibliography
database <Leader>cr, or :call TeXScanBibliography(). Otherwise the changes
does not take effect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*tex_variables* What variables this packages uses

Default values of this variables sets function TeXInit(), so if you want to
have yours you must set it after the TeXInit() is called. See |installation|
